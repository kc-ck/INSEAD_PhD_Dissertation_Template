%%% NOTES:

0. IMPORTANT: Download and unzip the INSEAD PhD Dissertation LaTeX Template file to preserve directory structure

1. Requires the following Class file in your LaTeX install - Thesis.cls  (Class ZIP file is included in the folder, in case you want to manually install it in your miketex installation location)

2. Other packages should install automatically if you have set it so, else it will require manual installation. 

3. This is modularly built - as in each chapter can have a separate .tex file which is called via \include command. See below in the CHAPTERS folder

4. All pictures go into a separate \images folder, so as to be easier to find and reference. 

5. I used BIBLATEX, but feel free to change. See % BIB CALLS comment below.

6. As usual, compile sequence: PdfLaTEX - BibTEX -  PdfLaTEX PdfLaTEX

%% good luck!
