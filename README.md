%%% NOTES:
%1% Requires the following Class file in your LaTeX install - Thesis.cls  . ZIP file is included in the folder, in case you want to manually install it in your miketex installation location
% Other packages should install automatically if you have set it so, else it will require manual installation. 

%2% This is modularly built - as in each chapter can have a separate .tex file which is called via \include command. See below in the CHAPTERS section

%% All pictures go into a separate \images folder, so as to be easier to find and reference. 
%% All tables go into a separate \tales folder, so as to be easier to find and reference

%% I used BIBLATEX, but feel free to change. See % BIB CALLS comment below.
